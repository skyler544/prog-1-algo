# Linear Hash Table with Quadratic Probing

## Usage:
  1. Call `make` in the project root
  2. Run executable via `./bin/stocks`
  3. Optionally, when rebuilding, use `make clean`

## Windows:
  1. You probably need to change the `EXE` variable in the `Makefile` to something like `stocks.exe`.
  2. If `make` isn't available for Windows, I have no idea how to build this project.
